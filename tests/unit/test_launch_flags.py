"""Direct unit pin for the ``LAUNCH_FLAGS`` table's silent-overwrite invariant.

End-to-end flag dispatch (every flag's payload-field translation) is
covered through the public CLI in ``tests/integration/test_resource_launch_cli.py`` —
that's the right home for those assertions per AGENTS.md ("Test through public APIs").

What an integration suite *cannot* observe is a collision: if a future
edit makes two ``LaunchFlag`` rows share the same ``accepts_key``,
``_build_launch_payload`` walks the table in order and silently
overwrites the earlier value with the later one. The bug only surfaces
if both colliding flags are exercised with different values in the same
test run — too fragile to rely on. This test pins the uniqueness so a
duplicated row fails CI before integration tests even run.
