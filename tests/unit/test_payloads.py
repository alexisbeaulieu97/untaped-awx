"""Pin the typed boundary at ``untaped_awx.domain.payloads``.

``ResourceClient`` reads return :class:`ServerRecord`; writes accept
:class:`WritePayload` / :class:`ActionPayload`. The dict-style access
methods on ``ServerRecord`` reach into ``__pydantic_extra__``, which is
Pydantic v2's documented attribute for ``extra="allow"`` fields. These
tests pin the public contract so a Pydantic v3 rename fails fast at the
boundary instead of cascading into integration runs.

The docstring at ``payloads.py:34`` explicitly recommends a test named
``test_server_record_dict_access``; the cases below cover that name and
the surrounding contract.
