"""Declarative description of a single AWX resource kind.

A :class:`ResourceSpec` is the **domain** view of a kind: identity,
foreign-key references, secret paths, fidelity, available actions. It
carries no transport detail (URL paths, HTTP verbs, CLI names) — those
live in :class:`untaped_awx.infrastructure.spec.AwxResourceSpec`, which
extends ``ResourceSpec`` with the additional fields the framework needs
to actually talk to AWX and wire CLI commands.

Use cases in ``application/`` annotate ``ResourceSpec`` so they can be
exercised against any kind without depending on AWX-specific transport.
