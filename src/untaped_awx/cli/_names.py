    """Return a copy of ``rows`` with each FK id replaced by its server-resolved name.

    Two passes:

    1. **Declared FKs** — every entry in ``spec.fk_refs`` is flattened
       (single or multi). Multi FKs (``credentials = [30, 31]``) become
       lists of names.
    2. **Display-only FK columns** — when ``columns`` is provided, any
       column whose name matches a top-level key with a corresponding
       ``summary_fields.<col>.name`` is also flattened, even if the
       column is not in ``spec.fk_refs``. This catches FK fields that
       live in ``read_only_fields`` because their identity comes from
       ``metadata.parent`` rather than the spec body — the canonical
       case is Host's / Group's ``inventory``.

    A missing ``summary_fields`` entry falls back to the original id
    so bad/partial server responses don't disappear mid-pipeline. Only
    rows are copied at the top level — nested values are shared with
    the input, so don't reuse a row dict you intend to mutate.

    Dotted column names (``summary_fields.inventory.name``) are
    deliberately excluded from extra-column flattening: the user is
    already addressing nested data directly via the row renderer's
    dotted-path walker, so flattening would double-resolve.
