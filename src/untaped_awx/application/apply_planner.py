"""Build the identity dict and resolved payload for the apply pipeline.

:class:`ApplyPlanner` is the first collaborator the orchestrator hits:
it passes ``resource.spec`` through minus the apply drop-set, resolves
FK names to ids, drops sub-endpoint multi-FKs (those go through the
membership reconciler, not PATCH), and returns the identity dict
strategies use to ``find_existing``.

:func:`scope_for` is the FK-lookup-scope helper used by every caller in
the apply pipeline that resolves FK names: the planner itself,
``MembershipReconciler.plan`` (``apply_membership.py``), and
``apply_prefetch.prefetch_plan`` (bulk warm-up). Pure module-level function
— sharing it keeps the prefetch path's cache buckets aligned with what
the apply path actually queries.
