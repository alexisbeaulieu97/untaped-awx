"""ResolveCasePayload: turn a domain :class:`Case` into the dict POSTed to AWX.

Resolution is **top-level on declared FK fields, never recursive**, so
opaque user content under ``extra_vars`` etc. is never inspected.
``!ref`` sentinels are resolved separately by walking the whole tree —
that's the only path that descends into nested values.
