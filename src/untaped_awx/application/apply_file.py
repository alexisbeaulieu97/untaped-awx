"""Use case: apply a file or directory of resource docs in dependency order.

The orchestrator collects every doc via an injected
:class:`ResourceDocumentReader`, derives a kind dependency graph from
each spec's ``fk_refs`` (consulting the :class:`Catalog`), topologically
sorts the docs so an upsert can resolve its FKs against already-applied
parents, then dispatches each through :class:`ApplyResource`. Errors are
non-fatal by default; pass ``fail_fast=True`` to abort on first failure.

Before the apply loop runs, :meth:`FkResolver.prefetch` is called with
the set of ``(kind, scope)`` groups the docs reference so FK lookups
collapse from N round trips per kind into one paginated ``list``.

Note: the reader is a port (Protocol) defined in
``application/ports``. Concrete YAML / JSON / stdin readers live in
infrastructure and are wired by the CLI composition root.
